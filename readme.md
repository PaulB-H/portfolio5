## Welcome to my fifth portfolio project!

Many of my previous portfolios have had a "retro" feel, so this is my attempt to make something that looks a bit more modern.

## Project List:
- PokeSim
- WeatherDash
- Day Planner
- Routine Builder
- FitHub
- xcelsolutions.ca

## Interesting fixes
Anchor class so when I click a link on my fixed nav-bar, the section-header is not covered

```css
.anchor {
    padding-top: 65px;
    margin-top: -65px;
}
```
