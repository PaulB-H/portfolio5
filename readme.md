## Welcome to my fifth portfolio project!

Many of my previous portfolios have had a "retro" feel, so this is my attempt to make something that looks a bit more modern.

## Project List:
- PokeSim
- WeatherDash
- Day Planner
- Routine Builder
- FitHub
- xcelsolutions.ca

## Interesting fixes

Anchor class so when I click a link on my fixed nav-bar, the section-header is not covered
```css
.anchor {
    padding-top: 65px;
    margin-top: -65px;
}
```

Center an element using absolute positioning
```
    Add left: 50% to the element that you want to center. ...
    Add a negative left margin that is equal to half the width of the element. ...
    Next, we'll do a similar process for the vertical axis. ...
    And then add a negative top margin equal to half its height.
